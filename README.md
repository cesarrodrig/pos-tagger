# Part-Of-Speech Tagger

The exercise consists of building a Part-Of-Speech tagger trained on the
[GUM corpus](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/) and using the
Universal Dependencies syntax annotations from
[here](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-GUM/tree/master).

Part-Of-Speech tagging is the process of annotating the words of a sentence
with their grammatical role in a sentence with respect to its meaning
and context. Examples of tags include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
